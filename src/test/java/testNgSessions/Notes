TestNG
: unit testing framework
: QA automation
: Only for JAVA
: Junit

Python: Pytest, unittest
C#: Nunit
Php: PhpUnit
JS : Jasmine, Mocha

: to write the test cases
	: with annotations
		: pre conditions
		: test steps
		: post steps

: open source
: can integrated with Maven, Gradle
: can be integrated with Jenkins (CI-CD)
: generates html reports, Allure, Extent Report
: provides many annotations to design the and maintain the test cases
: provides Data Provider for Data Driven Testing

Test Case:
Global Pre Conditions: @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass
Pre Conditions: @BeforeMethod
	Test Steps: @Test, @DataProvider
	Actual vs Expected Result -- Assertions
Post Steps : @AfterMethod
Global Post steps : @AfterClass, @AfterTest, @AfterSuite


beforeMethod,AfterMethod will be always executed with Test if written. Its a pair
Its a precondition we write in TestCaseDoc,like launch URL its needed before every test. 
Whereas others like BfSuite,BfTest,BfClass will be executed only once unless its written twice or no.of times in the code.
And BTest,Bsuite,BM,BClass its not mandatory to write everything in the code,Whichever suits/req write only that.
Always BefMethod Test AfterMethod execution is a gud practice cos in negativecases where browser is crashed, it will close and move on to next cases as afterMethod is there.
Execution Percentage will be gud if BM and AM approach is used
Test-alphabetical order if not specified, Priority can be given like 1,2 etc
